            In order to redirect to paypal, I had to create this page and then paste the generated link into the next link element.
            I could not use <cite>cy.visit()</cite> directly to go to paypal, as this would change the URL of the test and retrigger it.
            The reason is <cite>cy.visit()</cite> is bound to <cite>baseUrl</cite> set in config and when you go to a different URL,
            the baseUrl has to change to (probably because of same-origin policy).
            Right now there's an issue to allow different <cite>baseUrl</cite> per test: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2636.
